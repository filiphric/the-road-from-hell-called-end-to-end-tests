# selectors
<!-- 
- another pain point
- I still find it kinda wild that selectors are still a problem
- but it is still something I see people struggling with, and it can indeed be a hellish nightmare
- good news is that approach is evolving

<!--
- cypress threw all this away parent/child, two step approach
- select by text or query - then filter out stuff

<!-- 
- came with suggestion - add your own data-cy attributes
- I think adding your own data-cy selectors was a very good push
- it makes tests more stable, forces developers and testers to work together
- I strongly believe that more collaboration the better

# selectors

:logos-playwright {class="w-20 h-20 block my-10"} 

```js
page.getByRole()
page.getByText()
page.getByLabel()
page.getByPlaceholder()
page.getByAltText()
page.getByTitle()
page.getByTestId()
```

<!--
- Playwright came with this opinionated approach
- Michal Drajna is going to have a great talk on all things Playwright, make sure to stay in the room after this one
- really great IMO, pushed the community to use accessibility selector
- I think this might probably be the best approach, not because you are killing two birds with one stone, but for two reasons
  - tests should resemble user behavior
  - frameworks we use should inspired good practices
- accessibility will be a requirement soon, some directives from EU are already in place

# Tests should be easy to read. Selectors are a big part of that

<!--
- using such selectors will make tests more readable
- Iâ€™m pushing a lot for test readability
- good selectors are a big part of that
- The reason for this is debugging
