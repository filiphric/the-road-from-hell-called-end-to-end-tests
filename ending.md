<!--
- I want to finish this presentation off by taking another look at the testing pyramid
- I said that about half of the people might leave when I show this, so thank you to everyone that stayed
- the reason why we don’t like to look at it is because we as testers know, that our job is way more complex
- and these simplifications don’t do justice to our work
- but I also believe that they don’t do justice to the tools we have today
- this model is 15 years old, we have better tools now
- I think that e2e tests don’t have to be a hellish experience anymore
- and that this model is as outdated as the tools we had 15 years ago
